# Resources

This page collects the final project resources for the Flex Sensor Subsystem, including the firmware (MPLAB X project) and any CAD files used for 3D-printed parts.

## Firmware Project (MPLAB X)

The complete MPLAB X project for the final Version 1.0 firmware is provided as a zipped archive.

**Final MPLAB X code project (.zip):**  
 [Download MPLAB X project](flex_firmware_mplabx.zip)

## CAD Files for 3D-Printed Parts

If any mechanical or mounting components were 3D-printed (e.g., sensor brackets, PCB standoffs, door interface mounts), the associated CAD files are provided here as a zipped archive.
