# Welcome to Lakshanand Sugumar’s Subsystem Datasheet

## Automatic Door Opener — Team 103

## Introduction

This datasheet focuses on the design and programming of the Flex Sensor in the Private Use Automatic Door Opener

## Project Summary

This project focuses on the Motor Control Subsystem — one of the four key subsystems of the Automatic Door Opener. The overall system is designed to enable door operation through sensors rather than traditional buttons or handles, providing hands-free access for improved safety, convenience, and accessibility in households where users often have their hands full.

The Motor Control Subsystem receives input from two IR sensors, a flex sensor, and a rotary encoder. These inputs allow the subsystem to interpret when to activate, stop, or disengage the motor during door movement. In particular, the flex sensor plays a crucial role in detecting door bending or resistance. It compares its readings with the rotary encoder values to determine if the motor should continue running or stop — for instance, when the door is fully open, obstructed, or manually disengaged. This helps prevent unnecessary power consumption and enhances system safety.

The final team report will integrate this subsystem with the other three — Sensor Detection, Control Logic, and Power Management — showing how they communicate and share data to achieve seamless automatic door operation.
