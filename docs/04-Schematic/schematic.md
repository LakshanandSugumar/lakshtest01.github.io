title: Schematic

**Overview:**  
The schematic shows all connections for the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano, power regulation, sensor input, and interface headers.  
Bypass capacitors (0.1 ÂµF) are placed near each VDD pin. The regulator receives 9â€“12 V from an external adapter and provides a clean 5 V rail to the board.
