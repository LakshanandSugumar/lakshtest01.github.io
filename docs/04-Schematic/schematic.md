## üß© Schematic

**Overview:**  
The schematic shows all connections for the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano, power regulation, sensor input, and interface headers.  
Bypass capacitors (0.1 ¬µF) are placed near each VDD pin. The regulator receives 9‚Äì12 V from an external adapter and provides a clean 5 V rail to the board.
