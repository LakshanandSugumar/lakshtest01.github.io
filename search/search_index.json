The overall system is designed to enable door operation through sensors rather than traditional buttons or handles, providing hands-free access for improved safety, convenience, and accessibility in households where users often have their hands full.</p> <p>The Motor Control Subsystem receives input from two IR sensors, a flex sensor, and a rotary encoder. These inputs allow the subsystem to interpret when to activate, stop, or disengage the motor during door movement. In particular, the flex sensor plays a crucial role in detecting door bending or resistance. It compares its readings with the rotary encoder values to determine if the motor should continue running or stop \u2014 for instance, when the door is fully open, obstructed, or manually disengaged. This helps prevent unnecessary power consumption and enhances system safety.</p> <p>The final team report will integrate this subsystem with the other three \u2014 Sensor Detection, Control Logic, and Power Management \u2014 showing how they communicate and share data to achieve seamless automatic door operation.</p> <p>For a complete overview of the full system design and team collaboration, visit the team report.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Created and maintained a public GitHub test repository for initial code and documentation setup.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managed the team\u2019s main GitHub repository, ensuring version control, organization, and consistent updates across all subsystems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Served as the Assignment Leader, coordinating team tasks, integrating individual subsystem work, and ensuring timely submission of deliverables to Canvas.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Individual Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This subsystem is responsible for reading analog data from the flex sensor and communicating the interpreted results to the motor subsystem to control door movement.
